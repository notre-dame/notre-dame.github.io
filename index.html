            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Pineapple Fund was an experiment in philanthropy with cryptocurrency wealth. What happens when your 'play-money' becomes a treasure chest, and you're past the satiety point of money?</p>
            <p>I decided to donate the majority of my cryptocurrency to charities around the world, with an open application process and funding charities big and small. I focused on causes I believe in, or causes I know will work from my experiences.</p>
            <p>Timed with the 2017 crypto bubble, 5104 BTC was turned into $55 million for charities. I'm happy and proud of the impact that will come, mostly thanks to the amazing charities and the dedicated people behind them.</p>
            <p>I'm going to remain anonymous, because the point of the Pineapple Fund is not me. I consider this project a success. If you're ever blessed with crypto fortune, consider supporting what you aspire our world to be :)</p>
            <p>♥, Pine</p>

              <p>On a larger scale, the Pineapple Fund created a more mysterious form of cryptocurrency philanthropy.</p>
              <p>The organization was started in December by an anonymous donor who goes by the nickname “Pine” and claims to be among the 250 largest holders of Bitcoin in the world. The fund aims to give away $86 million worth of Bitcoin, and has already given $20 million worth of the currency to 13 organizations, including million-dollar donations to the Water Project, which provides clean water to people in sub-Saharan Africa, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights watchdog.
              <p>(These donations can be verified thanks to Bitcoin’s digital ledger system, which records every transaction in a public database.)</p>
              <p>Whoever Pine is, he or she seems to have found a way to convert Bitcoin into something actually useful.</p>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <p class="q">Who are you, and why?</p>
            <p class="a">Sometime around the early days of bitcoin, I saw the promise of decentralized money and decided to mine/buy/trade some magical internet tokens. The expectation shattering returns of bitcoin over many years has lead to an amount far more than I can spend.</p>
            <p class="a">What do you do when you have more money than you can ever possibly spend? Donating most of it to charity is what I'm doing. For reference, The Pineapple Fund is bigger than the <em>entire market cap</em> of bitcoin when I got in, and one of the richest 250 bitcoin addresses today.</p>
            <p class="q">How many bitcoins do you have?</p>
            <p class="a">The Pineapple Fund represents a majority of my cryptocurrency holdings.</p>
            <p class="q">Why are you remaining anonymous?</p>
            <p class="a">Publicity has never been the point of this fund.</p>
            <p class="q">I'm an individual. Can I get some bitcoins?</p>
            <p class="a">The answer is no. Pineapple Fund is charity, but not that kind of charity.</p>
            <p class="q">I have a media request...</p>
            <p class="a">Feel free to email contact at this domain, and I'll get back to you!</p>
            <p class="q">Why the name, Pineapple Fund?</p>
            <p class="a">I really like pineapple. Did you know that pineapples contain high levels of bromelain, which has been shown to be an effective anti-inflammatory, muscle relaxant, and digestive aid?!</p>
